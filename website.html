   <h3>Melody All Grown</h3>
   <p> I was born January 8, 2000 in Monterey Park. I grew with an older brother and I'm also bilingual, speaking both Chinese and English! One of the most embarrassing memories I had growing up was when I was in elementary and I accidentally ran into the boys restroom because I really had to go.Now, I'm kind of all grown up. I'm currently 18 years old and on my way to starting my freshman year at UC Berkeley!
